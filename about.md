Evan N. is an electronic musician and interdisciplinary artist based in Atlanta, GA, working under the alias, E Noodle. The artist's mission is to explore the possibilities of creative interaction between human and hardware + software. Their projects often work towards combining the two, utilizing both digital processing and analog equipment. Demonstrated with performances on electric bass and various synthesizers, they produce music + video not possible without blending the two. Inspired by early consoles and retro computing, the artist embraces an aesthetic that merges the capability of modern tech with lo-fi of years prior, often reducing bit-rates + resolutions and working with pixel art. Throughout this work, they aim to emphasize human aspects within the ever-increasingly computerized world we inhabit.â€‹
