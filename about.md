Evan N. is an electronic musician and interdisciplinary artist based in Atlanta, GA, working under the alias, E Noodle.
The artist's mission is to explore the possibilities of creative interaction between human and hardware + software. 
Their projects often work towards combining the two, utilizing both digital processing and analog equipment. 
Demonstrated through performances of bass guitar and various synthesizers, 
they produce music and accompanying videos not possible without blending the two. 
Inspired by early consoles and retro computing, the artist embraces an aesthetic that merges 
the capability of modern tech with lo-fi of years prior, often reducing bit-rates + resolutions and working with pixel art. 
Throughout this work, the artist aims to emphasize human aspects within the ever-increasingly computerized world we inhabit.â€‹
